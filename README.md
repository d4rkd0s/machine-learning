# machine-learning
A repo that stores all my project files as I learn and perfect machine learning

## Intro

Files are in order 1_****, 2_****, 3****, etc

Explanation of each file can be found below.


### 1_first_tests.py

This was the first file I worked with/in that starts with importing and basic playgrounding on Tensorflow. There is a lot of print statements to make sense of it all and its a great place to start if you are reading this as an absolute begginer

### 2_mnist_starting_example.py

This file is where I started working with NumPy and the MNIST data sets, they are also located in this repo and if you clone and use the python scripts in this repository it will most likely utilize the ones here in this repo. (Untested). This file was majorly a copy from the Tensorflow docs on MNIST basics. It was there for me to analyze and fiddle with.

###  3_mnist_first_tests.py

Here I started getting my feet wet with the MNIST data. Achiving ~92% accuracy with simple methods like `GradientDescentOptimizer` and `softmax regression`.
